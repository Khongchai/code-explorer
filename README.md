## Introduction
Hey there, fellow code enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Code Explorer, your go-to place for diving into real-world, industry-grade code. 

## What is Code Explorer?
This repository is a curated list of real-world use cases of algorithms and design patterns in open-source projects that are not just popular but also battle-tested. **We focus on projects with a minimum of 1,000 stars**. Each project is categorized by the key algorithms and design patterns it employs. For example, if algorithm `A` is used in an open source project `foo`, then you will be shown exactly where `A` is in project `foo` and how it's used.

## Why Code Explorer?
I have seen many tutorials that go in-depth into how algorithms work or how to apply design patterns, but I have yet to see a collection of quality references that help guide the user and say "look here, this algorithm, here it is, and here is how it's used in a real code base". Not that this type of explanation don't exist, but it's spread all over the internet. 

## Project Structure
This is a long-term project, maybe I get a lot of contributions, or maybe I just do this for myself, either way, more stuff will be added, so it's not very practical to put everything into README.md like other lists. Here's a project structure that I think works for this format.

ðŸ“¦ Code-Explorer (root)

 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ algorithms
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ binary_heap

 â”£ ðŸ“œ CONTRIBUTING.md
 â”— ðŸ“œ README.md


 All code samples and references should be inside of the `resources` folder. If you would like to contribute a new category, feel free! For now, what I have in mind are `algorithms`, `design-patterns`, and `math`.

 More details about contributing can be found in CONTRIBUTING.md
